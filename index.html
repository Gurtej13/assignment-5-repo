		<p class="css-question">Applying CSS to HTML

			First, let's examine three methods of applying CSS to a document: with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.
			External stylesheet
			
			An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external stylesheet to our web page.
			HTML:
			<code>
				<!doctype html>
				<html lang="en-GB">
				  <head>
					<meta charset="utf-8" />
					<title>My CSS experiment</title>
					<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
				  </head>
				  <body>
					<h1>Hello World!</h1>
					<p>This is my first CSS example</p>
				  </body>
				</html>
			</code>
			CSS:
			<code>
				h1 {
					color: blue;
					background-color: yellow;
					border: 1px solid black;
				  }
				  
				  p {
					color: red;
				  }
				  
			</code>
			</p>

			In this article, About JavaScript
			Use JavaScript within a webpage
			
			Take your webpages to the next level by harnessing JavaScript. Learn in this article how to trigger JavaScript right from your HTML documents.
			Prerequisites: 	You need to be familiar with how to create a basic HTML document.
			Objective: 	Learn how to trigger JavaScript in your HTML file, and learn the most important best practices for keeping JavaScript accessible.
			About JavaScript
			
			JavaScript is a programming language mostly used client-side to make webpages interactive. You can create amazing webpages without JavaScript, but JavaScript opens up a whole new level of possibilities.
			
			Note: In this article we're going over the HTML code you need to make JavaScript take effect. If you want to learn JavaScript itself, you can start with our JavaScript basics article. If you already know something about JavaScript or if you have a background with other programming languages, we suggest you jump directly into our JavaScript Guide.
			How to trigger JavaScript from HTML
			
			Within a browser, JavaScript doesn't do anything by itself. You run JavaScript from inside your HTML webpages. To call JavaScript code from within HTML, you need the <code>script</code> element. There are two ways to use script, depending on whether you're linking to an external script or embedding a script right in your webpage.
			Linking an external script
			
			Usually, you'll be writing scripts in their own .js files. If you want to execute a .js script from your webpage, just use <code> script </code>with an src attribute pointing to the script file, using its URL:
